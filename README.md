## Project Goals

**Baby Bites Blog** is a Full-Stack site designed for busy parents and caregivers who want to feed their babies well — but often don’t have the time, energy, or knowledge to prepare fresh, age-appropriate meals every day.
Introducing solids can be confusing and stressful. Between lack of sleep, returning to work, and managing household responsibilities, many parents find themselves asking:
- What should my baby eat at this age?
- Is this food safe?
- Do I have time to make something nutritious — or will it just be another pouch?
Baby Bites was created to solve these challenges. This platform provides simple, fast, and nutritious recipes tailored for babies aged 6 to 12 months, so parents can feel confident about feeding their little ones — even on the busiest days.
The goals of the project are to:
✅ Take the guesswork out of what to cook for babies at each age stage
✅ Offer quick and healthy recipes using everyday ingredients
✅ Support parents who want to feed their babies real food but feel overwhelmed or short on time
✅ Reduce the reliance on store-bought baby food by making homemade meals accessible
✅ Empower caregivers with clear, practical feeding guidance without the stress
✅ Build a supportive community where users can comment on recipes, ask questions, and share their own creations
✅ Encourage collaboration between parents, creating a space where real-life experiences and tips can be shared openly
By combining nutrition, convenience, and real-life practicality, Baby Bites helps parents turn mealtime into something simple, joyful, and nourishing — even when life is chaotic.
